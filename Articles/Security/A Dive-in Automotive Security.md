This article aims to elucidate fundamental concepts critical for effective cyber security implementation in automotive software destined for Electronic Control Units (ECUs) within vehicles.

## 2. Basic Automotive Concepts

### 2.1. What Does the Car Look-like from Inside?

Looking inside a modern car, you'll find a complex blend of technology. The car's insides resemble a network where different parts, called zoned-architected Electronic Control Units (ECUs), talk to each other. These ECUs are spread throughout the car and work together to control lots of things like how the engine runs, how safe the car is, and even stuff like entertainment and helping the driver. This setup shows how the car's software is really intricate, and these ECUs need to talk well to keep the car running smoothly. Making sure they're secure is super important to keep the car working right and safe for everyone.

#### 2.1.1. ECU Network and Organization

Examining the following image, you'll notice that the car houses numerous ECUs, grouped strategically based on factors such as safety, security, and functionality. It's important to emphasize that the car's engine compartment functions as a network of ECUs, which interact using communication buses like CAN bus, as well as occasionally using other buses like LIN, Ethernet, and more.

![1692395318874](image/ADive-inAutomotiveSecurity/1692395318874.png)

#### 2.2.1.1. Root of Trust

The concept of a "Root of Trust" serves as the foundation for secure booting. This involves establishing a trusted and unalterable starting point within the ECU or SoC, often rooted in hardware. This root of trust acts as a reference point, assuring that subsequent software components are genuine and untampered. It can be seen as a ROM bootloader that is always checking the next secondary bootloader (firmware) that will execute and run the application eventually.

#### 2.2.1.2. Authentication of Firmware at Booting

Cryptographic techniques, like digital signatures and hash functions, are key elements in secure booting. Digital signatures verify the authenticity of the software components using cryptographic keys, while hash functions validate their integrity. This layered approach ensures that only authorized and unmodified software can proceed through the booting process, effectively safeguarding the ECU or SoC against potential security breaches.

#### 2.2.1.3. Decryption of Firmware at Booting

An additional (sometimes optional) layer of protection is introduced through firmware decryption. Encrypted firmware is read during booting and decrypted using cryptographic keys stored in the root of trust. This step maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive code and data. Firmware decryption, combined with secure booting, forms a robust defense that not only verifies software authenticity and integrity but also shields it from unauthorized access. This comprehensive strategy enhances automotive security by thwarting a wide range of threats and safeguarding the intricate software landscape of modern vehicles.

#### 2.2.1.4. Last Words About Secure Booting

The importance of diagnostics cannot be understated, as it enables mechanics and technicians to pinpoint problems swiftly and accurately, reducing downtime and enhancing vehicle reliability. However, the critical nature of these diagnostics data necessitates protection against unauthorized access and potential misuse.

#### 2.2.2.2. Secure Authentication Sequence for Diagnostics

To address this concern, authentication mechanisms are implemented within Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and Automotive System-on-Chips (SoCs). For instance, in the ISO Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol, service requests like 0x27 (Security Access) and 0x29 (Seed & Key) are employed. These involve a sequence where the requesting entity proves its legitimacy, gaining access only if it successfully follows the established authentication process.

Another layer of security involves the utilization of a random seed. During communication between the diagnostic tool and the UDS server within the ECU, a random seed is exchanged. This seed serves as a basis for generating cryptographic keys, ensuring that only authorized parties with the correct seed can access and manipulate the diagnostics data.

The following sequence diagram shows an example of using the service (0x27 - Security Access) and its sub-services (0x1 - Request Seed) and (0x2 - Send Key) for the ECU to authenticate the tool and allow it to get some sensitive data using the other diagnostics services.

The sequnece is as follows:

1. Testing tool requests a seed from the ECU.
2. ECU respondes with Random Number generated inside it.
3. Testing tool does a cryptographic operation on the key and re-sends it to the ECU.
4. The server in the ECU, does the same cryptographic operation and make sure that the same output is expected from the testing tool.
5. Once the result of this sequence is as expected, the ECU grants this testing tool access to the configured services. Otherwise, it will reject the authentication.
